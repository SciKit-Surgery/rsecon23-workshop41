# RSECon23 Workshop 41: How to use and contribute to a software sustainability dashboard
These are materials for our [workshop at RSECon2023](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/4430/submission/41), taking place September 6th in Swansea UK. You will find links to workshop materials and activities to perform before and after the workshop. 

## Workshop Aims
The workshop seeks to contribute to a better understanding of what sustainable research software is and how improving sustainability leads to increased impact. 

Participants will finish the workshop having set up a software sustainability dashboard for their own selected projects and gained an understanding of how to improve the sustainability of their own projects. 

## Workshop Format
The workshop will consist of;
* a short (20 minute) [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-su-f5TJVs3DY157Ya3NA1YMdavd42wMsfij3cNzZIY/edit#slide=id.g2584fceb0d3_0_20) from the organisers.
* half on hour of live coding using our [sustainability dashboard template](https://github.com/SciKit-Surgery/sustainable-pkg-stats).
* half an hour of discussion (face to face and using mentimeter)
* A short wrap up. 

## Before the Workshop
### Essential
The template is designed to run on GitHub actions. Please create a GitHub account before the workshop.

### Optional

* Take a look at our software sustainability dashboard [template](https://github.com/SciKit-Surgery/sustainable-pkg-stats). Follow the instructions in the README.
* Think about whether the dashboard is going to work for your software.
* Is there other open-source software that you would like to try the dashboard on?
* Check out the [further reading](#further-reading).
* Think about what you think sustainable software is.
* Think about what you think the most important metrics are for sustainable software.
* [Get in touch](#get-in-touch) and let us know if there's anything else you think should be covered in the workshop.
